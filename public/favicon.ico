<!-- 
This is a placeholder for favicon.ico
In a real project, you would need to generate a proper .ico file using tools like:
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- Or using image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, etc.

For now, you can convert the SVG icons we created to .ico format using online converters.
